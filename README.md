# SF-Movies-Finder
A react project to find movies near a location in San Francisco.

The user enters the location in the dropdown provided. Then on the submit button, the location selected is matched with all locations from the API response and corresponding movies are printed.

The solution focuses front-end JS code.

I have kept the architecture simple as this is the first React project I have made.

In this project, there is scope of writing unit tests as well and improving the UI (CSS).

I have written the Node.js code for fetching and validating the details of movies. It can be found at the following link:
